Simple Calculator Explanation

Overview
This program is a very basic calculator. It can:
1. Add two numbers
2. Subtract one number from another
3. Multiply two numbers
4. Divide one number by another
5. Raise a number to a power
6. Find the square root of a number

How It Works

1. Start
   - The program asks you for two numbers.
   - You type in each number and press Enter.

2. Choose an Operation
   - The program shows a menu:
     1: Addition
     2: Subtraction
     3: Multiplication
     4: Division
     5: Exponentiation (power)
     6: Square Root (uses only the first number)
   - You type the number of the operation and press Enter.

3. Do the Math
   - The program calls the matching function to do the math.
   - It prints “Answer is: X” where X is the result.

4. Continue or Exit
   - After showing the result, it asks:
     1: Continue
     2: Close
   - Type 1 to do another calculation or 2 to end the program.

Key Parts of the Code

1. enum Actions
   - Gives names to the numbers 1–6 (Add, Subtract, etc.)

2. struct DoMath
   - Addition: adds two numbers
   - Subtraction: subtracts the second number from the first
   - Multiplication: multiplies the two numbers
   - Division: divides the first number by the second
   - Exponentiation: raises the first number to the power of the second
   - GetSquareRoot: finds the square root of the first number (supports negative with complex numbers)

3. getNumber(prompt)
   - Shows a prompt message
   - Reads an integer from the user
   - Keeps asking until the user types a valid number

4. main()
   - Loops forever until you choose to close
   - Uses getNumber to get inputs and choice
   - Uses switch on the choice to call DoMath functions
   - Asks whether to continue or stop
